# Pokemon-Photo-Tag_API
Project: Created the back-end functionality for a photo tagging application. 

# Summary 
Developed a RESTful API for a 'Where's Waldo?' inspired game, incorporating model schemas to store user data including their three-character username and completion time. Implemented a delete route and controller to manage the top 10 leaderboard, automatically removing the slowest record when a new entry is added. Leveraged MongoDB to create a database that exclusively retains the top ten records, ensuring efficient leaderboard management. Records are only saved to the database if the user achieves a top ten placement in the game.
